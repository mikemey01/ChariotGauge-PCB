# Build Your Own
The latest iteration of the controller is in the Version 2 folder. These are all of the gerber files needed to build your own controller from any PCB MFG. The chariotgaugev2.zip contains only the necessary files that any PCB mfg would need.

I use and recommend Advanced Circuits.

Steps for assembling the controller can be found here: https://www.chariotgauge.com/install-guide-diy/

# Modify
If you want to modify the PCB I've included the board and schematic files from Eagle CAD. You'll need to install Eagle CAD to view/edit the schematics.

# Chariot Gauge DIY
There are three parts to the Chariot Gauge project, this is the PCB repo:
* [Chariot Gauge Controller Firmware](https://github.com/mikemey01/ChariotGauge-Firmware)
* [Chariot Gauge Controller](https://github.com/mikemey01/ChariotGauge-PCB)
* [Chariot Gauge Android App](https://github.com/mikemey01/ChariotGaugeAndroid), or [Chariot Gauge iOS App](https://github.com/mikemey01/ChariotGaugeiOS)
