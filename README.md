# ChariotGauge-PCB
All of the gerber files for creating a Chariot Gauge PCB controller yourself.

# Build Your Own
The latest version of the controller is in the Version 2 folder. These are all of the gerber files needed to build your own controller from any PCB MFG. 

I use and recommend Advanced Circuits.

# Modify
If you want to modify the PCB I've included the board and schematic files from Eagle CAD. You'll need to install Eagle CAD to view/edit the schematics.
