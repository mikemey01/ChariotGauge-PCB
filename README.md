# Build Your Own
The latest iteration of the controller is in the Version 2 folder. These are all of the gerber files needed to build your own controller from any PCB MFG. The chariotgaugev2.zip contains only the necessary files that any PCB mfg would need.

I use and recommend Advanced Circuits.

# Modify
If you want to modify the PCB I've included the board and schematic files from Eagle CAD. You'll need to install Eagle CAD to view/edit the schematics.
